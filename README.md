List of Reddit posts from r/mechanicalkeyboards

Im expanding on [reddit-mk-posts](https://github.com/travissanon/reddit-mk-posts) to finish up on things that I didnt have time for on the original project.

To-do:
- [x] Fix `src/` file structure
- [ ] Replace all declared `any` types with the correct type for the property
- [ ] Add more tests
- [x] Add import aliases
- [ ] Uninstall redundant packages
- [ ] Maybe: Abstract some generic anonymous functions into a `utils/` folder

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install` (or `npm install`)

To add all dependencies for the app

### `yarn test` (or `npm test`)

Runs all tests

### `yarn start` (or `npm start`)

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
